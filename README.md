Custom-MVC
===========

Custom Build MVC Project from 2012.

__This project is not supported any more!__

The project uses the MVC pattern and uses Doctrine ORM as Database Abstraction Layer

In the application directory are some examples how to use the framework.

For documentation just look at the code in the __library/App__ (it speaks for it self)
